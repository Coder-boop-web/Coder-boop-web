## What I Love to Do

### Coding
Iâ€™m super into coding! Thereâ€™s just something about solving problems and building things from scratch that gets me excited. Whether Iâ€™m adding new features or optimizing existing ones, Iâ€™m always up for a challenge.

### Top Languages
Here are my go-to languages:

- **C++**: I love the power and performance that C++ brings, especially for building applications.
- **Java**: Iâ€™m all about creating solid, scalable software solutions with Java.

### Open Source Contributions
Iâ€™m a huge fan of open source! Contributing to these projects is my way of giving back to the community, learning new things, and collaborating with other passionate developers. Plus, itâ€™s a great way to meet like-minded folks!
